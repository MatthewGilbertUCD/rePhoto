# rePhoto
R package containing functions for finding the general geographic location of historical photographs. The rePhotograph-Vignette.html file can be downloaded and provides a thorough overview of the functions and setup. To view the Vignette save the file to your computer and open in a web browser (opening it directly in GitHub does not display the final view).
Two example inputs (points of reference locations and pixel values) and outputs (KML files openable by Google Earth or CalTopo) are available in the Vignette folder. This package will accompany a publication (not available yet).
