# rePhoto
R package containing functions for finding the general geographic location of historical photographs. 
This package will accompany a publication (not available yet).

OPENING THE DEMO: A thorough demonstration of the functions and setup is available as the rePhoto Vignette, in pdf, html or Rmarkdown formats. 
To view the html Vignette save the ZIP file to your computer and open in a web browser (opening it directly in GitHub does not display the final view).
Two example inputs (points of reference locations and pixel values) and outputs (KML files openable by Google Earth or CalTopo) are available in the Vignette folder.
