# rePhoto
R package containing functions for finding the general geographic location of historical photographs. The rePhotograph-Vignette.html file can be downloaded and provides a thorough overview of the functions and setup. To view the Vignette save the file to your computer and open in a web browser (opening it directly in GitHub does not display the final view). This package will accompany a publication (not available yet).
